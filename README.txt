One Way Trip
An exploration based game.

The main purpose of the game is to showcase an understanding of various concepts. Such concepts include, but
are not limited to:
Multi-threaded processing
Procedural Generation
Controlled Randomization
Game Balance

The game is driven by a single progression idea: exploring. You are an adventurer
and you want to travel and see everything the world has to offer. As such, you never
back track and only move forward. Any time you decide to explore, you will be given a 
(hopefully) new thing to experience. These will be referred to as events. They can be
several different things like:
Instances to explore
Places to trade in
Good and bad things
Ambushes
